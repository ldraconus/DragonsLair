# DragonsLair

This branch contains all of the code we believe works up to this point. When finished, this program will replace the system that is currently in place at Dragon's Lair comics and is intended to be reponsible for generating pull requests every week and taking in a .CSV that has all of the comics coming in for the week.

Currently built to be run directly from IntelliJ. Running from command line or a different IDE will likely result in errors.
It also requires a version of MySQL to be running on the machine being used for testing. When launching the program a message will appear telling you were to configure the database properties file for the MySQL connection. Once that has been configured, the program can be restarted to launch the software.
Default login is username-'admin' password-'admin'.
