# DragonsLair

This branch contains all of the code we believe works up to this point. When finished, this program will replace the system that is currently in place at Dragon's Lair comics and is intended to be reponsible for generating pull requests every week and taking in a .CSV that has all of the comics coming in for the week.

Currently built to be run directly from IntelliJ. Running from command line or a different IDE will likely result in errors.
It also requires a version of MySQL to be running on the machine being used for testing, and the password for the database to changed on or around line 15 of DB.java. This will eventually be changed to be a more elegant solution.
